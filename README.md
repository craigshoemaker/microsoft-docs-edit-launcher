## FAQ

### What if I don't have access to the private repo?

If you don't have access, then you'll need to send a request to the content team to grant you access.

### Why does it tell me a page is not editable after I click the edit button?

Some pages on docs.microsoft.com don't feature an edit button rendered on the page. This button is required for the extension to work.
